# Pascal's Triangle

Pascal's triangle is a concept of probability that is used to find coefficients in the expansion of binomial expressions `(x + y)n` where `n => 1` and `x, y` are real numbers. 

## Problem Task

```py

# Create a function def pascal_triangle(n): that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of n:

# Returns an empty list if n <= 0
# You can assume n will be always an integer

```
